# Lecture 03 – CSS Basics

## What I implemented this lecture
I have implemented basic CSS styling according to the requirements given in the assignment for this lecture.

## CSS selectors I used (at least 5)
- Element selectors: `body`, `header`, `footer`, `section`, `h1`, `h2`, `img`
- Group selector: `header, footer`
- Descendant selectors: `nav ul`, `nav li`, `nav a`
- Class selector: `.card`
- ID selectors: `#main`, `#projects`
- Pseudo-class selector: `a:hover`


## One thing I struggled with
- I forgot how to remove the bullets from list items and needed to look that up

## One improvement I want to do next
- I want to improve the styling of the navbar and of the footer to better fit to common web standards and for a better design
